	<h2>ANEMIA</h2>
		<h4>What is it?</h4>
		<p>
		<span>
			Anemia is defined as a low number of red blood cells. In a routine blood test, anemia is reported as a low hemoglobin or hematocrit. Hemoglobin is the main protein in your red blood cells. It carries oxygen, and delivers it throughout your body. If you have anemia, your hemoglobin level will be low too. If it is low enough, your tissues or organs may not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue or shortness of breath -- happen because your organs aren't getting what they need to work the way they should.

Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects almost 6% of the population. Women, young children, and people with long-term diseases are more likely to have anemia. Important things to remember are:

Certain forms of anemia are passed down through your genes, and infants may have it from birth.
Women are at risk of iron-deficiency anemia because of blood loss from their periods and higher blood supply demands during pregnancy.
Older adults have a greater risk of anemia because they are more likely to have kidney disease or other chronic medical conditions.
There are many types of anemia. All have different causes and treatments. Some forms -- like the mild anemia that happens during pregnancy -- arenâ€™t a major concern. But some types of anemia maymay reflect a serious underlying medical condition

		<h4>Preventive measures</h4>
		<p><span>
			While some types of anemia are short-term and mild, others can last throughout a lifetime. There are several ways to help manage anemia, including:

Following a healthy diet.<br/>
Drinking enough water to stay hydrated.<br/>
Exercising regularly. However, if you have been weak, you should begin exercising cautiously. Check with your healthcare provider about ways to exercise safely.<br/>
Avoiding exposure to chemicals that set off anemia.<br/>
Washing your hands often to avoid infection.<br/>
Taking good care of your teeth and going to the dentist regularly.<br/>
Talking to your doctor about any changing symptoms.<br/>
Keeping track of your symptoms by writing them down.<br/>

		<h4>Food items that can be eaten</h4>
		<p><span>
			With anemia, making good food choices is important. Eating junk food means you are getting calories without nutrients. You also have to consider other medical conditions that you have when you make your food choices.

Some things have been shown to impair iron absorption. You should not take calcium and iron supplements at the same time. In addition, you may want to avoid or limit these items:
<br/><br>
			1.Tannin-containing items like coffee, tea and some spices. <br/>
			2. Milk.<br/>
			3. Fiber. (You will not want to eliminate all fiber, though, because taking iron supplements could cause constipation.)<br/>
			4. Soy protein<br/>
			5. iron-rich foods and foods that provide vitamins B12,B9</b><br/>
			6. Citrus fruits, berries and other vitamin C-containing foods like peppers and tomatoes <br/>
			7. Meat<br/>
			8. iron from plant sources like lentils, spinach and pistachios. Whole grains and dark leafy vegetables.<br/>
